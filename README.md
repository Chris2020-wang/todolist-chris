How to use it?

1. When you click on the URL, it will be the home page for today, and you can click the "+" sign to add your new item and use the check box to delete your item!
2. If you want your todolist, you can add your list name to the end of the URL, then play with your todolist. for example, https://sleepy-chamber-02396.herokuapp.com/Chris, by adding Chris to the end of the URL and press Enter, I will get my todolist with the name of Chris! Hint: no matter what case letter you type, your list name will always be the first letter capitalized and followed by lower case letters. This is done by lodash.
